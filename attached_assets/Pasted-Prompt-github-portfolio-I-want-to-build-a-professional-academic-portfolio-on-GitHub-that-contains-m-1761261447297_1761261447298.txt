About : 
Hey, I’m a recent graduate at Syracuse University, with a masters degree in Computer Sciences. I’m a research intern at SU, working on building continually learning and adapting AI agents, to study cognition in Agentic AI systems, how agents think about their reasoning process, adapt and learn from users interactions over time. I’ve also done projects on machine learning, network analysis, natural language processing and computer vision.

Research vision : 
My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Computational Communication. I aim to study and design adaptive, human-centered AI systems that augment human decision-making and the cognitive processes guiding it. My approach combines computational methods such as network analysis, text and web mining, data analytics, machine learning, and cognitive modeling. Specifically, I am interested in bridging computational efficiency with metacognitive intelligence—developing intelligent systems that can reflect on their own reasoning processes, much like humans do in real-world decision-making contexts. Through this perspective, I seek to better understand patterns of communication, interactional biases in human-AI dialogue, and the dynamics of collaborative cognition. My long-term goal is to explore how AI can interpret, anticipate, and respond to human behavior, connecting computer science with cognitive and communication principles.
